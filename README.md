# Airline-System-Database

Skills: 🗃️ Database Design · 🧠 EERD · 💾 SQL · 🛠️ Data Normalization · 🗺️ Entity Relationship Mapping· 🤝 Team Leadership

For my Database II university course, I led a team to design and implement a relational airline management system using SQL, organizing data into four schemas (core, crew, customer, financial) to handle flights, crew assignments, bookings, and payments. I enforced business rules like crew rest periods, seat allocation, and baggage policies through constraints and triggers, ensuring data integrity. The project included ER modeling, normalization, and query optimization to support real-time operations like flight scheduling and payment processing.
